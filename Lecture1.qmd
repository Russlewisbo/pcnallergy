## Classic "high-risk" drugs for DRESS

<br>

-   Allopurinol

-   Aromatic antiepileptic agents (carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine, …)

-   Sulphonamides

-   Vancomycin

-   Minocycline

-   Nevirapine

-   Anti-tuberculosis drugs

-   Mexiletine

**β-lactams are lower risk**

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Drug-sensitized cytotoxic CD8+ T cells mediate keratinocyte necrosis

-   TEN has a mortality rate of approximately 30% that can exceed 50% in elderly or immunosuppressed patients. T

-   The severity-of-illness score for TEN (SCORTEN) algorithm facilitates clinical diagnosis and prognostication.

-   SJS is associated with the maintenance of long-lasting tissue-resident memory T-cell responses in the skin that persist after SCAR, necessitating accurate identification and lifelong avoidance of the culprit antibiotic

## **Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP)** {.smaller}

-   AGEP is a drug eruption characterized by an extensive sterile, nonfollicular pustular reaction superimposed on erythematous plaques, with a prominent leukocytosis and neutrophilic dominance

-   Most cases of antimicrobial-induced AGEP, such as that caused by β-lactams and quinolones, typically cause symptoms within a day of exposure, whereas other drugs take 7 to 14 days of exposure before symptoms.

## Penicillin allergy epidemiology

<br>

::: incremental
-   10-20% of patients will report a history of an allergy to PCN therapy 

-   However, only 0.5%-2% of all PCN administrations actually result in hypersensitivity reactions, most often rash 

    -   Of these 1% are IgE mediated 

-   The incidence IgE PCN allergies is decreasing, partially due to the reduced use of parenteral PCN, which degradation products in solution may be the primary culprit 

-   Statistics from the UK 1972-2007 oral amoxicillin:

    -   1 death after anaphylaxis with oral amoxicillin (35 years and 100 million treatment courses)

-   Most reports of penicillin allergy describe unknown or cutaneous reaction

-   Severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR)
:::

::: {.column width="50"}
**95% can tolerate penicillins**

-   Delayed, benign rash (Type IV reaction) that often does not recur with rechallenge
-   True IgE reactions wane over time, with 80% becoming tolerant after 10 years 
-   Many patients were never allergic, but had other symptoms they though represented a PCN allergy (concurrent viral infection, GI distress)

## Top 4 patient penicillin allergy myths {background-image="images/amoxicillin.png" background-opacity="0.1"}

<br>

::: incremental
-   **Once you have an penicillin allergy, you have it for life**

    -   Allergy wanes over time, 80% of patients with type I (IgE-mediated reactions) will not have an allergy after a 10 year period

-   **Viral rashes mistaken for antibiotic therapy**

    -   E.g., child with a viral exanthematous rash treated with a course of penicillin

    -   Pediatric studies have reported \>90% of children who developed rashes on antibiotic therapy do not develop a rash when rechallenged with penicillin again

-   **Adverse effects mistaken by the patient as drug allergy**

    -   E.g. diarrhea, stomach cramps

-   **“I have a family history of penicillin allergy”**

    -   No genetic basis has been identified for penicillin allergies

## PENFAST score {.smaller}

![](images/penfast.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

::: aside
The PEN-FAST clinical decision rule for patients reporting a penicillin allergy uses 3 clinical criteria of time from penicillin allergy episode, phenotype, and treatment required. A total score is calculated using PEN-FAST score in the upper panel,and interpretation for risk strategy is provided in the lower panel. ^a^Includes unknown. ^b^Forms of severe delayed reactions include potential Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermalnecrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and acute generalizedexanthematous pustulosis. Patients with a severe delayed rash with mucosal involvement should be considered to have a severe cutaneous adverse reaction. Acute interstitial nephritis, drug induced liver injury, serum sickness and isolated drug fever were excluded phenotypes from the derivation and validation cohorts.

## Direct oral amoxicillin challenge

![](images/amox_challenge.png){fig-align="center"}

::: aside
[@macy.etal_2023]
:::

## Rationale behind oral amoxicillin challenge

<br> <br>

-   Only ∼2% of penicillin “allergic” individuals develop an acute hypersensitivity reaction with an oral challenge of a therapeutic dose and 1 hour of observation. 
    -   An additional approximately 2% will have a delayed onset, typically benign, rash within the next 5 days. 
    -   The requirement for viral costimulation of T cells likely explains the low reproducibility of drug exanthems. 
-   Hence, a direct oral challenge with a single therapeutic dose of amoxicillin is an important step to avoid unnecessary penicillin allergy labels, and indicated in low-risk phenotypes and nonanaphylactic symptoms, such as those with benign delayed-onset rashes without systemic symptoms or SCAR features

## Penicillin skin test assessment

-   High negative predictive value (NPV) \~95% for IgE-mediated reactions

-   Poor positive-predictive value- Possible false positive diagnosis if used in patient with low pre-test probability

-   Amoxicillin is commonly used to challenge after negative penicillin skin tests as it addresses the core β-lactam of penicillin and also side-chain–specific reactions, which may not be detected through skin testing with penicillin itself (NPV 100% if both are negative)

-   Traditional penicillin skin testing or amoxicillin challenge may be negative in patients with historical reactivity to piperacillin-tazobactam. Skin testing to piperacillin-tazobactam may help to establish this selective sensitization, and these patients are often able to tolerate other penicillins

-   Penicillin skin testing has no value in delayed reactions, including SJS/TEN, DRESS, and other noncutaneous organ-based reactions

## Impact "medium risk" patients?

::: incremental
<br>

-   A negative skin test is associated with a 95% NPV for PCN allergy
-   A negative skin test plus negative amoxicillin challenge approaches 100% NPV for PCN allergy
-   If skin test is positive, amoxicillin challenge is not considered
-   Patient should be referred to an allergy/immunologist or desensitization considered
:::

## Desensitization

<br>

::: incremental
-   Progressive, graded de-granulation of mast cells (histamine release) and internalization of high-affinity IgE receptors by administering graded doses of antibiotic
-   Desensitization is contraindicated in patients with a history of a penicillin-induced exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis
-   Desensitization has no effect on the incidence of non-IgE mediated reactions such as serum sickness, hemolytic anemia, maculopapular rashes, drug fever, hepatitis, or interstitial nephritis
-   If the patient does not receive a dose for a period of more than 24 hours, the risk for an immediate IgE-mediated reaction can be restored and repeat desensitization is required if the same drug is to be used again

::::: columns

-   Common teaching: If a patient has a documented PCN allergy, the risk of cross reactions with cephalosporins is 10%
-   THIS IS FALSE, the actual cross reactivity is more likely 2%-3%

    -   Cefazolin as a unique side chain and and very low risk for cross-reactivity

## What is the cross-reactivity with carbapenems?

<br>

-   Cross reactivity with penicillin allergy and carbapenems is less than 1%
-   No cross reactivity between penicillins and monobactams (aztreonam)
-   A graded challenge or test dose can be considered:
    -   i.e. Infuse 5-10% of dose and observe patient, then progress to full dose if not reaction
    -   Skin testing (if available) could also rule out allergies

## Special populations that should be <br> considered for testing {.smaller}

<br>

-   **Peri-procedure before elective surgery**
    -   Importance of antibiotic timing/tissue levels at time of incision-less optimal with vancomycin that requires longer infusion
-   **Pregnancy**
    -   PCN allergy associated with increased risk of cesarean delivery, post-cesarean wound complications, and longer length of stay
    -   Consider third trimester referral for testing in patients with planned cesarean delivery, group B streptococcus colonization
-   **Long term care facilities**
    -   Non-beta-lactam based therapies have higher risk for drug interactions
    -   Higher risk for adverse effects
-   **Hematology-oncology**
    -   Consider testing before chemotherapy or transplant (onset of of immunosuppression)
-   **STD clinics**
-   **ICU patients?**

## <br> <br> <br> <br> Non-penicillin allergies? {background-image="images/TMPSMX.png" background-opacity="0.2"}

## Similar principles- patient history is key

<br>

-   Which drugs was the patient taking?
-   Dates of intake
-   Exact sequence of events
-   Underlying disease/Concomitant infections
-   Other drug administered at the same time/concomitant infections
-   Clinical morphology (at several time points)of rash
-   Histology of eosinophilia?

## Intradermal testing-Non beta-lactams

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/intradermal.png){fig-align="center" width="800"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Skin tests for most antimicrobial agents lack high negative predictive values, and skin test positivity is often a function of the time elapsed since the index reaction
-   Prick and intradermal tests less well standardized- non-irritating formulations required
-   Some antibiotics are irritating even at low concentrations, making testing difficult
-   Special cellular activation tests may be available in some centers for some drugs
    -   e.g., The BAT (flow cytometry) detects the upregulation of activation markers CD63 and CD203c on the surface of basophils after incubation with the implicated drug

## Sulfonamide hypersensitivity

<br>

-   Incidence 8%
-   Primarily cutaneous and GI tract
-   Only 3% are considered true hypersensitivity reactions.
    -   Most common presentations are limited exanthems and fixed drug eruptions
    -   However...sulfonamides are disproportionately associated with infrequent severe side effects (i.e. TEN, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome)
-   Mechanisms IgE-mediated are known to occur, but other poorly understood direct T-cell mediated mechanisms are more likely to be responsible
-   Higher incidence of reactions in patients with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis

## Take home messages

<br>

-   Penicillin allergies are the most common “contraindication” to antibiotic therapy, but most histories do not represent true allergies
-   A systematic approach can be used to evaluate and potentially “de-label” patients with penicillin allergy
-   Cross-reactivity rates are low with current cephalosporins and carbapenems, but can alternatively be addressed through antibiotic challenges and skin testing
-   Desensitization can be attempted in specific cases when a particular antibiotic is needed for IgE-mediated reactions
-   Some antibiotics cause non-immune-related hypersensitivity reactions that can be managed by slowing infusions and administering antihistamines
